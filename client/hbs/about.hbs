<strong>Down to the Wire</strong> is a collaborative project hosted by a group of students across the country. Since we share many common interests, we decided to merge all of our individual blogs and technical writings into a single website, where all of us can contribute. Since each author has different interests and personal projects, topics range from hardware to software to security.
